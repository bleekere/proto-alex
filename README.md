# Brulez goes to Alexandria

## What
An Alexandria prototype of some text documents by author Raymond Brulez

## Why
For two reasons: 

(1) to test the TAG model of text; to evaluate the Alexandria repository, and to experiment with the collaborative workflow it supports;
(2) to examine the source documents of Brulez' short stories.

## How

- Research visit dr. Elena Spadini, Universit√© de Lausanne
- Collaborative editing of a small subset of Brulez' manuscripts in TAGML

## Contents of the repo

- digital facsimiles of the manuscripts and typescripts of the story 'La Lanterne de projection "Aladin"' (written in 1929)
- tagml files with transcriptions of the manuscript and typescripts
- TEI encoding guidelines used in a previous Brulez-project at the Centre for Manuscript Genetics, Antwerp University
